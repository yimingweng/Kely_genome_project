# Kely_genome_project
The genome assembly project for the Tomato Pinworm, *Keiferia lycopersicella* (Walsingham)

## Background
- The tomato pinworm is a small moth feeds on mostly tomatoes and sometimes eggplant. The damage is mainly on the leaf through the leaf-mining feeding habit.
- The tomato pinworm is hard to be distinguished from several other closely related species by the external morphology.
- The host range of tomato pinworm is mainly on Solanaceae especially the tomato, but the attacks to other species like egg plant and some weed species in the family are documented.
- A comprehensive document about this species can be found in the [Featured Creatures website](https://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/veg/tomato/tomato_pinworm.htm) published by University of Florida.
- It would be interesting to have a genome assembled, annotated, and published for this species, as it could provide a promising scientific value to understand the pest ecology/evolution and potentially the genes involved in the host plant selection.

## General Workflows
This section describes the steps we have for a general genome assembling pipeline from raw reads to a well-annotated genome or even some further analyses.

### Read Quality Assessment

### Read Cleanning and Adapter Trimming

### Contig Assembling

### Scaffolding [optional]

### Polishing and Purging Haplotigs

### Feature Annotation

### Functional Annotation
